## As a developer, I want to be able to view current work priorities within a defined timeframe "sprint" so that I know what needs to be worked on and what work is coming up that still needs to be done.

### Acceptance Criteria: A developer will be able to log into the service to view the current product backlog of committed items, be able to review what is left in the current sprint and review items in future sprints that have been planned but not committed to just yet. Developers will be able to set which items they are working on, add comments and give status to each item which includes: in-progress, blocked, dependency-hold, QA/QC and complete.

## As a product owner, I would like a interface I can interact with that allows me to see the status of the projects I am apart of and be able to view what has been completed / left to go. I would also like to set priorities and communicate my thoughts directly to the team without over-reaching active development.

### Acceptance Criteria: A product owner will be able to log into the service and be able to view work items but not be able to interact directly with current commitments or change workflow directly. Product owner will be able to leave comments which will be visible to the developers so that everyone is aware of any changes.
