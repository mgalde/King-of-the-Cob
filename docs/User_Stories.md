# User Stories

## User Story breakdown

* As a developer, I want to be able to view current work priorities within a defined timeframe "sprint" so that I know what needs to be worked on and what work is coming up that still needs to be done.

  * Acceptance Criteria: A developer will be able to log into the service to view the current product backlog of committed items, be able to review what is left in the current sprint and review items in future sprints that have been planned but not committed to just yet. Developers will be able to set which items they are working on, add comments and give status to each item which includes: in-progress, blocked, dependency-hold, QA/QC and complete.

* As a product owner, I would like a interface I can interact with that allows me to see the status of the projects I am apart of and be able to view what has been completed / left to go. I would also like to set priorities and communicate my thoughts directly to the team without over-reaching active development. The product owner will also set the final due dates and establish the first project milestone.

  * Acceptance Criteria: A product owner will be able to log into the service and be able to view work items but not be able to interact directly with current commitments or change workflow directly. Product owner will be able to leave comments which will be visible to the developers so that everyone is aware of any changes. The product owner will also be able to establish the end date and the date for first minimal viable product.

* As a SCRUM master I would like to poll each project to easily discover project status, be informed of any blockers and communicate any changes to the team in a timely matter.

  * Acceptance Criteria: A SCRUM master will be able to login to the service and be able to see a dashboard of all projects, identify all committed points within a sprint and identify the project status. A SCRUM master will have all identified blockers seen immediately on login and must be addressed before moving forward. The SCRUM master will also conduct a daily stand-up with each developer on the project to identify what tasks are being worked on that day and make sure that tasks are in the correct priority as identified as the product owner.

* As a SCRUM master I would like to be able to generate meeting requests and schedules based on the product backlog.
  * Acceptance Criteria: The SCRUM master would be able to log in and from the dashboard be able to create a schedule based on each projects backlog set by the developers and established completion date set by the product owner. The SCRUM master will be able to schedule sprint planning meetings, sprint retrospectives and set product demo dates to demonstrate project progress.
